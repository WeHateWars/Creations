## Introduction

As events related to Zhan Xiao become more and more severe as [we recorded](https://github.com/WeHateWars/Recording), cyber citizens are fighting back bravely, using their creativeness. People are making their way out via creating art works, writing essays, etc.

It will be extremely painful if we lose track of those talented works. Therefore, we'll try our best to record the works here.

Again, no guarantee on the completeness and the quality of this collection. We are too busy.
